# h5_easy_access
Generate a simple C interface for hdf5 files

This is currently in early development. Reading is sort of complete, writing only supports group creation with attributes at this time.

Check out the example to get an idea how this works. Documentation is going to come.
In short:
 - write a .yaml file to define your data layout. Pass it to the generator script to get a C source code file and a header file.
 - include the generated header file into your c program
 - read the header file to see what you can do
 - compile your program. Do not forget to link in the hdf5 library (both `-lhdf5` and `-lhdf5_hl` are needed).

# Define your data layout
The data layout of your hdf5 file is defined with [YAML](https://yaml.org/).
Your configuration has three fields:
## name
This field defines a prefix for all generated functions and data types

## silent
If set to true, all output from the hdf5 library is surpressed. You will still receive error messages if functions generated by h5_easy_access fail.

## groups
This field defines all types of groups that can be created (or read) in your hdf5 file.
It consists of three sub-fields.

### name
This field defines a name for your group type. It will be used in the names of the generated functions.

### attributes
This field contains a list of attributes that will be attached to your group. Here, you can store metadata or whatever else you might need in addition to your actual data.

Each attribute consists of at least two sub-fields.

#### name
The name of the attribute. Must be a valid C variable name.

#### type
The C data type of your attribute. Not all are supported. Create an issue if your favourite data type is not supported.

#### shape (optional)
Attributes can be multidimensional arrays. Shape is an array of sizes for each of the dimensions of your attribute. You can use integer numbers or names of other attributes as sizes.

#### default (optional)
Here, you can give a default value for your attribute. For char array attributes, you can put a string here.

#### h5name (optional)
Here, you can put an additional name for the attribute that is only used inside the hdf5 file. This name can be any string, whereas `name` must be a valid C variable name.
