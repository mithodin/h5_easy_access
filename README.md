# h5_easy_access
Generate a simple C interface for hdf5 files

This is currently in early development. Reading is sort of complete, writing only supports group creation with attributes at this time.

Check out the example to get an idea how this works. Documentation is going to come.
In short:
 - write a .yaml file to define your data layout. Pass it to the generator script to get a C source code file and a header file.
 - include the generated header file into your c program
 - read the header file to see what you can do
 - compile your program. Do not forget to link in the hdf5 library (`-lhdf5` and `-lhdf5_hl` are needed).

# Define your data layout
The data layout of your hdf5 file is defined with [YAML](https://yaml.org/).
Your configuration has three fields:
## name
This field defines a prefix for all generated functions and data types

## silent
If set to true, all output from the hdf5 library is surpressed. You will still receive error messages if functions generated by h5_easy_access fail.
